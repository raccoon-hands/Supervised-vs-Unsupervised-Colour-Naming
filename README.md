# Supervised-vs-Unsupervised-Colour-Naming
This study aims to compare and evaluate the performance of supervised and unsupervised machine learning models when trained on qualitative crowd-sourced colour naming data for uniformly sampled points in CIELUV colour space.  Also explored are the effects of synthetic oversampling and Gaussian noise injection on generalisation ability.
